bio: Mechanical Engineering graduate student currently doing
    autonomous-vehicle related research at Indiana University.
    Extensive experience of 2+ years in computer vision and software
    development. Here's a quick summary of my past work- - Writing
    software for the Windows platform in Microsoft's UWP and WPF
    frameworks. As a member of the Windows team at Samsung, I wrote
    code in C++ and C# while following a variety of software design
    patterns. - Building and training deep learning models for
    computer vision applications. Kept up-to-date with the latest
    advancements in the field to ensure that the models achieved
    state-of-the-art performance. Wrote code in the Python programming
    language and deep learning frameworks including PyTorch,
    Tensorflow, and Caffe. - Held monthly seminars and workshops to
    share my findings with my peers.
