Title: "aboutme"
---

Hi, welcome to my website. I'm a former AI Development Engineer at Raven Industies. I am currently working towards my Masters in Computer Science at 
Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis under the supervision of Dr. Mohammad Al Hasan.  
\
In terms of academic and professional interests, I enjoy
bridging theory and application in several subdomains of
machine learning and computer vision, most notably semantic
segmentation and domain adaptation. At Raven, my responsibilities lied in designing AI and ML algorithms in 
an attempt to develop smart and safe autonomous farm vehicles such as tractors and combines. Currently at the data mining lab at IUPUI, my work revolves around dealing with continuously changing data distributions in Machine Learning, often referred to as [lifelong learning](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/lifelong-machine-learning.html)  
\
In my spare time I try to get better at playing
the piano, compete in online programming contests and
write articles for my blog.
