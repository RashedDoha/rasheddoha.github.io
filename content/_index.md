Title: "aboutme"

Hi, welcome to my website. I'm an AI Development Engineer
currently working on precision agriculture and autonomy at Raven Industies.  
\
In terms of academic and professional interests, I enjoy
bridging theory and application in several subdomains of
machine learning and computer vision, most notably semantic
segmentation and domain adaptation. As a fresh graduate, I
worked at Samsung Research for 2 years where I worked in
multiple teams to develop software for Samsung's mobile
devices. At Raven, my responsibilities lie in designing AI and ML algorithms in 
an attempt to develop smart and safe autonomous farm vehicles such as tractors and combines.   
\
In my spare time I try to get better at playing
the piano, compete in online programming contests and
write articles for my blog.
