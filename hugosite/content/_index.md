Title: "aboutme"
---

Hi, welcome to my website. I'm a Mechanical Engineering
graduate student currently working on autonomous vehicle
research under the guidance of Dr. Anwar and Dr. Hasan at
Indiana University.  
\
In terms of academic and professional interests, I enjoy
bridging theory and application in several subdomains of
machine learning and computer vision, most notably semantic
segmentation and domain adaptation. As a fresh graduate, I
worked at Samsung Research for 2 years where I worked in
multiple teams to develop software for Samsung's mobile
devices.  
\
In my spare time I try to get better at playing
the piano, compete in online programming contests and
write articles for my blog.
